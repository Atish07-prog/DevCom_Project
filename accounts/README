1. Creating a New User (Registration)
When Ananya types her details into your React form and clicks "Sign Up," the data goes on a journey:

Step 1: The Request (React) React sends a package of data (Name, Email, Password, Role) to the URL /api/register/.

Step 2: The Receptionist (urls.py) The URL file sees the address and sends the package to the RegisterView.

Step 3: The Translator (serializers.py) The RegisterView hands the package to the RegisterSerializer.

It checks if the email is valid.

It sees the write_only: True rule and prepares to hide the password.

Step 4: The Security Guard (create_user) Inside the serializer, the create method calls User.objects.create_user. This is the most important part: it hashes (scrambles) Ananya's password so no one can read it.

Step 5: The Warehouse (models.py) Finally, a brand-new row is written into the database. Ananya is now a permanent part of the table you see in your Django Admin!


2. Validating a User (Login)
Now, Ananya comes back the next day to Log In.

Step 1: The Input Ananya enters her Email and Password in React. React sends this to the /api/login/ address.

Step 2: The Swap (MyTokenObtainPairSerializer) The data arrives at your custom login serializer.

It takes the email she typed.

It searches the database: "Do we have an 'Ananya' with this email?"

Once found, it swaps her email for her Username so Django is happy.

Step 3: The Password Check (Validation) The serializer calls super().validate(). Django now takes the password Ananya just typed and compares it to the "scrambled" password in the database.

How? It doesn't unscramble the old password. It scrambles the new password using the same "recipe" and checks if the two scrambled versions match.

Step 4: The Golden Ticket (JWT Token) If they match, the View sends back a Token (a long string of random letters).

Step 5: Access Granted React saves this Token. For the rest of her session, whenever Ananya wants to see a "Member's Only" page, React just shows the Token to Django, and Django lets her in without asking for her password again.
